# Describe the benefits of using cloud services

## Introduction

What benefits cloud computing offers. 

How cloud computing can help customers meet variable demand. 

Security, governance and manageability

## Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

Uptime(availability) and the ability to handle demand (scale)

### High availability

High availability is crucial when deploying **applications, services, or IT resources**. It ensures that these resources **are accessible and usable when needed,** dispite potential disruption or events.

It enables organizations to adjust their resources to meet changing demands.

### Scalability

Scalability refers to the **ability to adjust resources to meet demand.**

Benefits: **not overpaying for services.** The customers could pay for what they use. If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.

Vertical scaling is focused on **increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources.** 

Horizontal scaling is **adding or subtracting the number of resources.**

### **Vertical Scaling**

add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine

### Horizontal Scaling

you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out. In the same manner, 

## Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud

### **Reliability**

Reliability is the ability of a system **to recover from failures and continue to function.**

- enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world.
- cloud environment itself will automatically shift to different region for you, with no action needed on your part.

### Predictability

Predictability can be focused on **performance** predictability or **cost** predictability.

**Performance**

- How many resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers.
- Autoscaling, load balancing, high availability are some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability

**Cost**

- Predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend
- Track resource use in real team, monitor resources to ensure that they are in most efficient way
- Data analytics, trend.
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator t

## Describe the security and governance in the cloud

**governance**

Deploying Iaas or Saas features support governance and compliance. Things like **set templates** help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements

**Cloud-based auditing** helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies

**Security**

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides **physical resources and control over operating systems and installed software**

Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Software as a Service (SaaS) deployments offer **automatic patches and maintenance**

Cloud providers are well-suited to handle distributed **denial of service (DDoS) attacks**, making your network more robust and secure

## Describe the benefits and manageability in the cloud

**Management of the cloud**

How to manage your cloud environment and resources

- Auto scale reosuces
- Preconfigured template for deploying
- Health monitoring, auto-replace failing resources
- Receive automatic alert

**Management in the cloud** 

How you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources

- Through web portal
- CLI
- APIs
- Powershell
